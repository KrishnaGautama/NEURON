# NEURON
NEURON is a simulation environment used for modeling individual neurons and networks of neurons. It is widely used in computational neuroscience to simulate the electrical activity of cells in the brain and nervous system. NEURON supports both biophysically detailed models (e.g., multi-compartmental models with ion channels) and simplified point-neuron models, making it highly flexible for a range of research needs.
